    "In this assignment you predict the number of emergency COVID-19 triages from NHS England. When you call 111 or 999 and complete the questions the operator asks you, you may be classified as having COVID-19. Every day hundreds to thousands of people call the NHS for a COVID-19 triage. The attached dataset breaks it down by clinical commissioning group (CCG) for England. "

The dataset we use is called 'assignment2_dataset_train.csv'. The last column contains the NHS triage counts and the variables of interest that you can use are: 'gyration_level', 'gyration_precent', 'home_share' and 'flow_percent'. "
